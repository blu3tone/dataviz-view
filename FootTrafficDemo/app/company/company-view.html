                                                <h4>Our History</h4>
                                                <p>IronRidge was founded in the mid-1990’s to create products that could support and protect off-grid solar installations. At the time, California’s Mendocino County was the epicenter of the residential solar industry, and solar arrays were primarily being installed on hand-built structures. IronRidge’s first products allowed solar panels to be secured to a steel pole that could be placed anywhere.</p>

                                                <p>In the years that followed, solar grew and evolved into a mainstream industry, with panels being installed on nearly every building type, in nearly every region of the world. IronRidge supported this evolution by developing standardized, code-compliant platforms for both roof- and ground-based solar. Our field-proven products are now supporting hundreds of megawatts of solar projects and are trusted by thousands of solar professionals across the globe.</p>
